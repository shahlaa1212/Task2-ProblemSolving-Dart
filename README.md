## 📝 [Task 2](https://github.com/shahlaa1212/Task2_Dart/tree/master/bin/task2)
* Create an empty List, add several integers to it, then calculate the sum of the numbers and
print it.

## 📝 [Task 3](https://github.com/shahlaa1212/Task2_Dart/blob/master/bin/task3/main.dart) 
* Create two Sets containing odd and even numbers from 1 to 10, then find their
intersection , difference, union and print their.  

## 📝 [Task 4](https://github.com/shahlaa1212/Task2_Dart/tree/master/bin/task4)
* You have two Lists: one containing the names of friends and the other containing the

the repeated characters in the phrase and print them.

## 📝 [Task 7](https://github.com/shahlaa1212/Task2_Dart/tree/master/bin/task7)
* You have an unsorted List containing numbers. Sort the list in ascending order using the
